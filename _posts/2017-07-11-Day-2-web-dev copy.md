Today we learned how to create the <canvas></canvas> tag. Using Javascript, we were able to use functions like fillRect, arc, lineTo, and others to draw onto the canvas. We took our first dive into Javascript variables in order to store the canvas object and also the context object, which is how we use our functions. After creating a watermelon and other drawings, we started working with animations. To do this we created an update() function and then called requestAnimationFrame(update) inside of it. Then we placed the code for our canvas drawings inside of this function. Using variables, we were able to increment and decrement the x and y values of our drawings in order to simulate motion.
