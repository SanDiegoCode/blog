Today we sketched out a picture of what we would like to build (a website or game). Then went on codepen.io to start the process. We went over HTML tags (<p></p>, <h1></h1>), and CSS selectors to style them with color, background-color, font-size, and font-family. Finally we went over id
s and classes that we could add to our html elements and then use those to style specific elements: id's are used for one element, and they have a unique name, while classes are for multiple elements, and the CSS selector for them are the # and . symbols respectively.
