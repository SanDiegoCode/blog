ROBOTS ARE COMING



We at SDC are excited to launch our next endeavor: Arduino Workshops.

Taking place during regular workshops, Arduino Workshops will be held in the Rancho Penasquitos Library from 4-5:30 every Friday.

However, due to limited supplies, students must sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9r7xyYdV5LLAdu-_GUO15NbkHvfMnFE30CSDn0hJ3Aaknfg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

#### What is Arduino?

Well the technical definition states that

> Arduino is an open source computer hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical world.

We at SDC refer to them as "Legos, but for Electronics"

Essentially, with an Arduino, you can create all sorts of hardware, from cars to fans to flashing lights. 

In addition, they're relatively inexpensive, super cool, and are easy to program. 

#### Sounds Great, How do I start?

Our Arduino Workshops are currently scheduled to start 08/18/17, but signups will be closing 08/11/17.
