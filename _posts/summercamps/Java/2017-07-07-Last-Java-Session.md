This is the last blog post during the java camps! Today we had some fun programming the DrawingTool to draw simple and complicated drawings using everything we've learned so far. We also showed off our text based adventures, which branch off into many convoluted paths. Everyone did a great job!![no image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12438494/27983212-a7ecd826-636b-11e7-89f6-fd9ab4d786ef.png "Group")Next week we will begin with our Web Design Camp, in which we will program our own websites. Since it will cover brand new topics, you don't need to have versed yourself in all of this week's topics in order to come next week. See you there!
