Hello, World!This is the first blog post during the camps! Today we had some fun programming one of our teachers to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, learning important lessons about having to tell computers exactly what you want them to do along the way. Afterwards, we got a little bit of an introduction to java programming by printing a simple statement.![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12438494/27813933-2a8e6de4-602e-11e7-9bd2-735215ad5258.jpg "Behind")![no image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12438494/27813926-1cca2c98-602e-11e7-878a-455c408e9388.jpg "sandwich")On Wednesday we will learn about variable creation and manipulation, and control structures such as if/else statements and while loops. We will have a little challenge at the end which takes into account everything we've learned so far.For the upcoming lessons we will be using certain libraries called **ConsoleIO** and **DrawingTool**. For those you will need to download these packages [here](/downloads/sandiegocodelibraries.zip)
