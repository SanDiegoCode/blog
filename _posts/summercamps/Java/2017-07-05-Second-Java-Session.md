Hello, World!Hope you had fun today in our major overhaul of Java and general programming concepts! Today we created and manipulated many different types of variables, including Strings, integers, Booleans, and characters. We also went over the control structures if/else statements and while loops, which is like an if statement that repeats as long as the statement is true.![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12438494/27898926-05826d6a-61dd-11e7-97de-789966905e26.png "img")![no image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12438494/27813926-1cca2c98-602e-11e7-878a-455c408e9388.jpg "sandwich")Tomorrow we will learn about more control structures, (for loops and while loops review), as well as floating point numbers. In conjunction, we will start to program with user input (the **ConsoleIO** library that you downloaded today!). This will include making text based games.For the upcoming lessons we will be using certain libraries called **ConsoleIO** and **DrawingTool**. For those you will need to download these packages [here](/downloads/sandiegocodelibraries.zip)
