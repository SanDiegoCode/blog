Today we sketched out a picture of what we would like to build (a website or game). 

Then we went on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) to start the process. We went over HTML tags (`<p></p>, <h1></h1>`), and CSS selectors to style them with `color, background-color, font-size, and font-family.` 

Finally, we went over `id`s and `class`es that we could add to our `html` elements and then use those to style specific elements

- id's are used for one element, and they have a unique name
- classes are for multiple elements

The CSS selector for them are the # and . symbols respectively.
