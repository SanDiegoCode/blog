Today we focused on the `<div> `tag and styling it with the width and heigh attributes. Then we were able to position it using `position:absolute` and then use `top` and `left` attributes to place the `div` where we wanted it. Next we used the` <img/>` tag with the `src` attribute to put images on our webpage.
