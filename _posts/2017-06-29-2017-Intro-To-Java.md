- On day one, we'll be using peanut butter â€” **If you are allergic, please [email us immediately](mailto:contact@sdcoding.com)**
- Bring your Mac / Windows laptop (Chromebooks won't work!)
- Make sure you install the software ahead of time


### Installing the Software

We will solve any issues on the first day of camp
